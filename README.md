# OBEx3-mygame

In this project we used the previous project (graph algorithms) and developed a logic way to play a game
in which a group of robots has to perform movement tasks in order to collect as many points as possible (by collecting fruit 
of different point value).
In this project you can choose:
1) Playing a manual game-the ability to choose where each robot starts and where it progresses at each stage).
2) Playing the automatic game-where the robots will go and play alone to collect as much score as possible.
