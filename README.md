# OBEx3-mygame

In this project we used the previous project (graph algorithms) and developed a logic way to play a game
in which a group of robots has to perform movement tasks in order to collect as many points as possible (by collecting fruit 
of different point value).
In this project you can choose:
1) playing a manual game-the ability to choose Where each robot starts and where it progresses at each stage).
2) playing the automatic game-where the robots will go and play alone to collect as much score as possible.
for more information about how our project work, we invite you to look in our wiki page.
